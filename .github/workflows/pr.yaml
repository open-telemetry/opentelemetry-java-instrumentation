  # testLatestDep is intentionally not included in the PR workflow
  # because any time a new library version is released to maven central
  # it can fail due to test code incompatibility with the new release,
  # or due to slight changes in emitted telemetry, which can be confusing for contributors
  # (muzzle can also fail when a new library version is released to maven central
  # but that happens much less often)
