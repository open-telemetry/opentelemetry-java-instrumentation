  testLatestDeps:
    # testLatestDeps is not included in the PR workflow by default
    # because any time a new library version is released to maven central
    # it can fail due to test code incompatibility with the new library version,
    # or due to slight changes in emitted telemetry, which can be confusing for contributors
    # (muzzle can also fail when a new library version is released to maven central
    # but that happens much less often)
    #
    # the condition is on the steps below instead of here on the job, because skipping the job
    # causes the job to show up as canceled in the GitHub UI which prevents the build section from
    # collapsing when everything (else) is green
    #
    # and the name is updated when the steps below are skipped which makes what's happening clearer
    # in the GitHub UI
