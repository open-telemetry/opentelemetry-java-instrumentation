  The executor instrumentation ensures that context is automatically propagated when using common
  Java executors (e.g., ThreadPoolExecutor, ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor, ForkJoinPool). When a task
  is submitted, the current context is captured and bound to the task. Then, when the task
  eventually runs, even if itâ€™s on a different thread, the instrumentation reactivates that context,
  enabling consistent correlation across concurrent and asynchronous workflows.
