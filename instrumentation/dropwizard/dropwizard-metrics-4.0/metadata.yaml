  The dropwizard-metrics instrumentation for the dropwizard/codahale metrics library produces
  OpenTelemetry compliant versions of the metrics generated by the Dropwizard MetricRegistry.

  The Dropwizard metrics API does not have a concept of metric labels/tags/attributes, thus the data
  produced by this integration might be of very low quality, depending on how the API is used in the
  instrumented application.
