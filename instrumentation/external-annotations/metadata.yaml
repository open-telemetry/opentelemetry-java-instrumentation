  The external-annotations instrumentation acts as a "shim" that automatically instruments methods
  annotated with custom or third-party tracing annotations. This is particularly useful if you have
  existing annotations (such as a custom @Trace or third-party annotation) that you want to leverage
  with OpenTelemetry. At runtime, this module recognizes those annotations and applies the
  appropriate OpenTelemetry instrumentation logic, including span creation and context propagation.
  Covers many common vendor annotations by default, and additional annotations can be targeted using
  the configuration property "otel.instrumentation.external-annotations.include".
configurations:
  - name: otel.instrumentation.external-annotations.include
    description: Configuration for trace annotations, in the form of a pattern that matches
      `'package.Annotation$Name;*'`.

    description: All methods to be excluded from auto-instrumentation by annotation-based advices.
