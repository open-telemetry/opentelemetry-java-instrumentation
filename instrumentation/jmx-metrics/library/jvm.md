# JVM Metrics

Here is the list of metrics based on MBeans exposed by the JVM and that are defined in [`jvm.yaml`](./src/main/resources/jmx/rules/jvm.yaml).

Those metrics are defined in the [JVM runtime metrics semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/runtime/jvm-metrics/).

## Limitations and unsupported metrics

There are a few limitations to the JVM metrics that are captured through the JMX interface with declarative YAML.
Using the [runtime-telemetry](../../runtime-telemetry) modules with instrumentation allow to capture metrics without those limitations.

[^1]: `jvm.thread.daemon` and `jvm.thread.state` attributes are not supported.

- [jvm.gc.duration](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/runtime/jvm-metrics/#metric-jvmgcduration) metric is not supported as it is only exposed through JMX notifications which are not supported with YAML.
- [jvm.cpu.time](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/runtime/jvm-metrics/#metric-jvmcputime) metric is not supported yet due to lack of unit conversion, see [#13369](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/issues/13369) for details.
