description: >
  Provides lightweight instrumentation of the Lambda core library, supporting all versions. It
  generates FaaS server spans with the `faas.invocation_id` attribute. Use this package if you only
  use `RequestStreamHandler` or know you don't use any event classes from `aws-lambda-java-events`.
  This also includes when you are using `aws-serverless-java-container` to run e.g., a Spring Boot
  application on Lambda.
  
  For custom wrappers when using library instrumentation, you can configure the `OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_AWS_LAMBDA_HANDLER`
  environment variable to contain your lambda handler method (in the format `package.ClassName::methodName`) and use
  one of wrappers as your lambda `Handler`.
