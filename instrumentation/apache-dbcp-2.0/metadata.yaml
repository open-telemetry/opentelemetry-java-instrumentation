  This instrumentation provides database connection pools metrics for Apache DBCP.

  The instrumentation uses `MBeanRegistration` methods for lifecycle detection, therefore it
  only activates if the `BasicDataSource` is registered to an `MBeanServer`. If using Spring Boot,
  this happens automatically as all Spring beans that support JMX registration are automatically
  registered by default.
