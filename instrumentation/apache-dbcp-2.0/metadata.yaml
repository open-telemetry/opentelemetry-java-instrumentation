  This instrumentation enables database connection pools metrics for Apache DBCP.

  The instrumentation uses `MBeanRegistration` methods for lifecycle detection, therefore it
  only activates if the `BasicDataSource` is registered to an `MBeanServer`. If using Spring Boot,
  this happens automatically as all Spring beans that support JMX registration are automatically
  registered by default.

      Opt-in to emit stable semantic conventions instead of the old
      experimental semantic conventions. Accepts a comma-separated list of semantic convention
      groups (e.g., `database`, `http`, `messaging`). Use `<group>/dup` to emit both old and new
      conventions simultaneously. Stable semantic conventions will become the default in version
      3.0 of the agent.
