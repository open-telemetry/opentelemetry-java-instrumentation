  The SOFARPC instrumentation provides RPC client spans and metrics, and RPC server spans and
  metrics for SOFARPC RPC calls.
  
  **Version compatibility**: 
  
  This instrumentation uses muzzle to verify compatibility with SOFARPC versions 5.0.0 and above.
  The instrumentation has been tested and verified with SOFARPC 5.4.0 through 5.12.0+.
  
  - **Minimum supported version**: 5.0.0 (required for requestBaggage support used in context propagation)
  - **Recommended for production**: 5.4.0 and above
  - **Tested versions**: 5.4.0 (primary test version) and latest.release (via testLatestDeps)
  
  While the instrumentation may work with versions between 5.0.0 and 5.4.0, these versions are not
  actively tested and may have compatibility issues. For production deployments, we strongly
  recommend using SOFARPC 5.4.0 or later.
