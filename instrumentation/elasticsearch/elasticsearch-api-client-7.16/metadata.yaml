  This instrumentation enriches Elasticsearch database client spans generated by the
  elasticsearch-rest-7.0 instrumentation by adding `db.elasticsearch.path_parts.id` and
  `db.elasticsearch.path_parts.index` attributes. It does not emit any telemetry on its own.
  Versions 8.10 and later of the Elasticsearch Java client have native OpenTelemetry support.
